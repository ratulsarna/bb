# Debugging And QA

- `pnpm dev` prints the active frontend URL, server API URL, host daemon port, data dir, and logs dir. Do not assume fixed dev ports.
- The packaged app defaults to server/frontend `:38886`, host daemon `:38887`, data dir `~/.bb/`, and logs under `~/.bb/logs/`.
- Entity IDs in URLs (`proj_*`, `thr_*`) are primary keys. Query them directly against the active data dir: `sqlite3 <data>/bb.db "SELECT * FROM threads WHERE id = 'thr_xxx';"`.
- API routes are under `/api/v1/`, for example `GET /api/v1/threads/:id`.
- Use `curl` against the server API to isolate frontend issues from server behavior.
- Use the CLI to inspect state: `pnpm bb thread show <id>`, `pnpm bb project list`, `pnpm bb status`. From source, use `pnpm bb:dev`.

## Local Dev QA Launcher

Use `scripts/bb-dev-app` when validating changes in the desktop dev app or helping QA from this checkout:

- `pnpm dev:status` runs `scripts/bb-dev-app status` to print the active branch, dev URLs, data dir, and logs.
- `scripts/bb-dev-app current` restarts the dev server on the current branch.
- `scripts/bb-dev-app main` fetches `origin/main`, fast-forwards `main`, and launches the dev server from this checkout.
- `scripts/bb-dev-app branch <branch>` switches to a local branch, or creates it from `origin/<branch>`, then launches the dev server.
- `scripts/bb-dev-app stop` stops the launcher-managed dev server and desktop.
- `scripts/bb-dev-app logs dev` and `scripts/bb-dev-app logs desktop` follow logs.

By default the launcher starts only the dev server (web frontend, server, host daemon) and prints the URL without opening a browser. Pass `--open` to open the browser after startup. Pass `--desktop` (e.g. `scripts/bb-dev-app current --desktop`) to also launch the Electron desktop shell — only do this when the user is testing a desktop-only change.

Branch switches intentionally keep dirty work in this checkout; git will stop if a local file would be overwritten. Set `BB_DEV_APP_STASH_DIRTY=1` for a one-off launch that stashes first.

For CLI QA against the dev instance, run `eval "$(scripts/bb-dev-app env)"` first. This sets `BB_SERVER_URL`, `BB_HOST_DAEMON_PORT`, and `BB_PROJECT_ID=proj_personal` so `pnpm bb:dev ...` does not accidentally target the packaged app.

Test agents with:

```bash
eval "$(scripts/bb-dev-app env)"
pnpm bb:dev thread spawn --project proj_personal --provider codex --permission-mode accept-edits --title "Smoke test" --prompt "Reply only with ok." --json
```

## Local Cloud

Run the Cloud dashboard and Connect worker against one local D1 database:

```bash
pnpm cloud:dev
```

The command applies migrations, seeds a local-only developer identity, and
prints the dashboard URL. Claim a handle, create a pairing code, and run the
displayed `bb connect` command against a bb started with `pnpm dev`. The same
worktree-specific local origin serves the dashboard at `localhost` and routes
`<handle>.localhost` through the Connect worker, so production Cloudflare and
GitHub OAuth credentials are not used.

To test the AI gateway, copy `apps/connect/.dev.vars.example` to the ignored
`apps/connect/.dev.vars` and set `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Ctrl-C stops the local
services. Local D1 state is kept under `.wrangler/cloud-dev`.
